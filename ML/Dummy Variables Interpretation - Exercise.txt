What are the reference (benchmark) categories for each categorical variable?
Solution:

data_cleaned['name_of_categorical_variable'].unique() and find which ones are missing.

The benchmark categories are as follows:

Brand -> 'Audi'

Body -> 'crossover'

Engine Type -> 'Diesel'

Registration -> 'no'

Naturally, if you reorder the categorical variables prior to using .get_dummies() you will be able to customize the reference category.
